Installation Instructions

Create a database
1. Create a mysql database
2. Use the mypbs.sql file to create the database tables

Download and configure files
1. Download mypbs10.zip
2. Extract all files to directory of choice
3. Open include/config.inc.php and edit required fields
4. Upload all files to your webserver directory that will hold your stats files
   i.e - http://www.yoursite.com/stats

Using MyPBS
1. In order to update stats for your team, open your browser and browse to the admin folder
   i.e - http://www.yoursite.com/stats/admin
2. First create a season
3. Once a season is added, you will see a link with the season name.  Click on the link and you will
   see more options that are pretty self explanitory.

   Note: adding players just adds names to the players table in the database. In order to associate a player
   with a season, just click on the season and use the "add player to this season" option.  This is done
   so that players can be added and removed from seasons easily.

Security Note
   The current release of MyPBS does not have a protected admin section.  You need to use htaccess or
   whatever your prefer to protect the admin folder.
